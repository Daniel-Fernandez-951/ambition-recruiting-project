## Ambition Recruiting Project

### Audience

This document is written for potential Ambition recruits. It contains all of the project-specific
information needed for a candidate to complete the project to the satisfaction of the hiring manager.

### Brief

This project is a Django application that acts as an encounter builder for a Star Wars tabletop RPG.
It uses starship data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) to allow a game master to build custom
or random space encounters for players.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to get all tests in the project to pass.
__The tests should not be modified__. They should be assumed to be accurate tests of the behavior of the
application. Instead, there are bugs in the project's codebase that are causing the tests to fail. It is
your job to fix the bugs in order to get all tests to pass.
